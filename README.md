# Assignment No. 5 – API Testing with JMeter

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **API testing using Apache JMeter**, covering **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) along with **CSV-based data-driven testing**. The tests are executed against the **RESTCountries API** to validate typical CRUD workflows.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will learn to:
- Build JMeter test plans with **Thread Groups**, **Samplers**, and **Listeners**.
- Automate **CRUD API workflows** (POST → GET → PUT/PATCH → DELETE → GET).
- Implement **CSV data-driven testing** in JMeter.
- Share and version control your projects via **GitHub**.

## Tasks Completed
1. Created JMeter test plan containing **GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE requests**.
2. Validated a full CRUD cycle:
   - **POST** → create a new resource
   - **GET** → verify resource creation
   - **PUT/PATCH** → update resource
   - **DELETE** → remove resource
   - **GET** → confirm deletion
3. Integrated **CSV file** to feed dynamic data into **POST requests** and perform validations.
4. Uploaded project files, including `.jmx` and 'Json' test plans and CSV files, to GitHub for sharing and version control.
